The Awfulizer
---

I wanted to see what I could do with Firefox extensions and some basic Javascript, CSS, and HTML knowledge. So here is a browser add on that will just cycle through random colors of backgrounds and text about 6 times a second. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Download the extension here: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awfulizer/>

## Notes:

* This extension can only turn the effect _on_ at the moment. Refresh your tab to reset.

## Future Implementation:

* Pop-up to choose cycle or just once. I kind of like the look of it just going on once.
* Options to choose these things and then also to do it once for every page after it loads.
