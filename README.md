I wanted to see what I could do with Firefox extensions and some basic Javascript, CSS, and HTML knowledge. So here is a browser add on that will just cycle through random colors of backgrounds and text about 6 times a second. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Notes:

* Implement button. Use 'background' in manifest and figure out how to inject the script into the current tab and remove it when you click the button again.
